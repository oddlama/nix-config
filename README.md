#### General & Miscellaneous

(WIP)

| ~~~~~~~~~~~~ | Source | Description
---|---|---
🗑️ Impermanence | [Link](./config/impermanence.nix) | Only persist what is necessary. ZFS rollback on boot. Most configuration is will be next to the respective service / program configuration.

- reverse proxy with wireguard tunnel
- restic
- static wireguard mesh
- unified guests interface for microvms and containers with ZFS integration
- zoned nftables
- Secret rekeying, generation and bootstrapping using [agenix-rekey](https://github.com/oddlama/agenix-rekey)
- Remote-unlockable full disk encryption using ZFS on LUKS <!-- with automatic snapshots and backups -->
- Automatic disk partitioning via [disko](https://github.com/nix-community/disko)
- Support for repository-wide secrets at evaluation time (hides PII like MACs)

## Structure

If you are interested in parts of my configuration,
you probably want to examine the contents of `users/`, `config/`, `modules/` and `hosts/`.
Also, a lot of interesting modules have been moved to [nixos-extra-modules](https://github.com/oddlama/nixos-extra-modules), a separate repository specifically for reusable stuff.
The full structure of this flake is described in [STRUCTURE.md](./STRUCTURE.md),
but here's a quick breakdown of the what you will find where.

|   |   |
|---|---|
`config/` | global configuration for all hosts
`config/optional/` | optional configuration included by hosts
`hosts/<hostname>` | top-level configuration for `<hostname>`
`modules/` | classical reusable configuration modules
`nix/` | library functions and flake plumbing
`pkgs/` | Custom packages and scripts
`secrets/` | Global secrets and age identities
`users/` | User configuration and dotfiles

## How-To

#### Add new machine

... incomplete.

- Add <name> to `hosts` in `flake.nix`
- Create hosts/<name>
- Fill net.nix
- Fill fs.nix (you need to know the device /dev/by-id paths in advance for partitioning to work!)
- Run `agenix generate` and `agenix rekey` (create's dummy secrets for initial deploy)

#### Initial deploy

- Create a bootable iso disk image with `nix build --print-out-paths --no-link .#images.<target-system>.live-iso`, dd it to a stick and boot
- (Alternative) Use an official NixOS live-iso and setup ssh manually
- Copy the installer from a local machine to the live system with `nix copy --to <target> .#nixosConfigurationsMinimal.config.system.build.installFromLive`

Afterwards:

- Run `install-system` in the live environment, export your zfs pools and reboot
- Retrieve the new host identity by using `ssh-keyscan <host/ip> | grep -o 'ssh-ed25519.*' > hosts/<host>/secrets/host.pub`
- (If the host has guests, also retrieve their identities!)
- Rekey the secrets for the new identity `nix run .#rekey`
- Deploy again

#### New secret

...

## Stuff

- Generate, edit and rekey secrets with `agenix <generate|edit|rekey>`

To be able to decrypt the repository-wide secrets (files that contain my PII and are thus hidden from public view),
you will need to <sub>(be me and)</sub> add nix-plugins and point it to `./nix/extra-builtins.nix`.
The devshell will do this for you automatically. If this doesn't work for any reason, this can also be done manually:

1. Get nix-plugins: `NIX_PLUGINS=$(nix build --print-out-paths --no-link nixpkgs#nix-plugins)`
2. Run all commands with `--option plugin-files "$NIX_PLUGINS"/lib/nix/plugins --option extra-builtins-file ./nix/extra-builtins.nix`

## Misc

Generate self-signed cert, e.g. for kanidm internal communication to proxy:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -days 3650 -nodes \
  -keyout selfcert.key -out selfcert.crt -subj \
  "/CN=example.com" -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:example.com,DNS:sub1.example.com,DNS:sub2.example.com,IP:10.0.0.1"
```

## Access backups

```
restic -o rclone.program="ssh -p 23 u000000@u000000.your-storagebox.de rclone" -o rclone.args="serve restic --stdio /home/restic/<subuser>/repo" -r rclone: stats
```
