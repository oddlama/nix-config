        This file manages the origin for this machine's repository-secrets. Anything that is
        technically not a secret in the classical sense (i.e. that it has to be protected
        after it has been deployed), but something you want to keep secret from the public;
        Anything that you wouldn't want people to see on GitHub, but that can live unencrypted
        on your own devices. Consider it a more ergonomic nix alternative to using git-crypt.

        All of these secrets may (and probably will be) put into the world-readable nix-store
        on the build and target hosts. You'll most likely want to store personally identifiable
        information here, such as:
          - MAC Addreses
          - Static IP addresses
          - Your full name (when configuring your users)
          - Your postal address (when configuring e.g. home-assistant)
          - ...

        Each path given here must be an age-encrypted .nix file. For each attribute `<name>`,
        the corresponding file will be decrypted, imported and exposed as {option}`repo.secrets.<name>`.
