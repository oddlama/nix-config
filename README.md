# About

This is my personal nix config. It's still in the making, but this is what I got so far:

- Full disk encryption using [disko](https://github.com/nix-community/disko), remotely unlockable via ssh
- Zoned nftables firewall
- Service isolation using [microvms](https://github.com/astro/microvm.nix) instead of containers
- Log and system monitoring via loki, telegraf, influxdb, promtail and grafana
- Single-Sign-On for all services using oauth2 via kanidm
- Automatic wireguard mesh generation
- Secret rekeying, generation and bootstrapping using [agenix-rekey](https://github.com/oddlama/agenix-rekey)
- Support for repository-wide secrets at evaluation time (hides PII like MACs)

## Hosts

Name | Type | Purpose
---|---|---
💻 nom | Gigabyte AERO 15-W8 (i7-8750H) | My laptop and my main portable development machine <sub>Framework when?</sub>
☁️  envoy | Hetzner Cloud server | Mailserver
☁️  sentinel | Hetzner Cloud server | Proxies and protects my local services
🖥️ ward | ODROID H3 | Energy efficient SBC for my home firewall and some lightweight services using microvms.
🥔 zackbiene | ODROID N2+ | ARM SBC for home automation, isolating the sketchy stuff from my main network

<!-- 🖥️ workstation -->
<!-- 🖥️ home server -->

<sub>
not yet nixified: my main development machine, the powerful home server, and some services (still in transition from gentoo :/)
</sub>

## Structure

- `apps/` Additional runnable actions for flake maintenance, like showing wireguard QR codes.

- `hosts/<hostname>` contains the top-level configuration for `<hostname>`.
  Follow the imports from there to see what it entails.

  By convention I place secrets related to this host in the `secrets/` subfolder, but any host
  could technically use them. Especialy important files in this folder are:

  - `host.pub` This host's public key (retrieved after initial setup). Used to rekey secrets so the host can access them at runtime.
  - `local.nix.age` Repository-wide local secrets. Decrypted on import, see `modules/repo/secrets.nix` for more information.

  Some hosts define microvms that run as their guests. These are typically stored
  in `microvms/<vm>` and have the same layout as a regular host.

- `modules/` contains modularized configuration. If you are interested in reusable parts of
  my configuration, this is probably the folder you are looking for. Unless stated otherwise,
  all of these will be regular reusable modules like those you would find in `nixpkgs/nixos/modules`,
  and the tree of all relevant modules is included via `modules/default.nix`.

  - `modules/config/` contains configuration that is I use across all my host and is applied by default.
    These just add configuration unconditionally and don't expose any further options.

  - `modules/optional/` contains configuration that is only needed sometimes, and which should
    be included explicitly by hosts that require it.

  - `modules/meta/` contains meta-modules that simplify the option interface of existing options.
    I use this for stuff that I don't need on all my hosts and that may require different settings
    for each host while sharing a common basis.

    Some of these are "meta" in the sense that they depend on their own definitions on multiple hosts (wireguard).
    These are probably as opinionated as stuff in `modules/config/` but may be a little more general.
    The `wireguard` module would even be a candidate for extraction to a separate flake, together with the related apps.

  - `modules/<xyz>/` regular modules related to <xyz>, similar structure as in `nixpkgs/nixos/modules`

- `pkgs/` Custom packages and scripts

- `secrets/` Global secrets and age identities
  - `global.nix.age` Repository-wide global secrets. Available on nodes via the repo module as `config.repo.secrets.global`.
  - `backup.pub` Backup age-identity in case I ever lose my YubiKey or it breaks.
  - `yk1-nix-rage.pub` Master YubiKey split-identity. Used as a key-grab.

- `users/` User account configuration mostly via home-manager.
  This is the place to look for my dotfiles.

- `nix/` library functions and flake plumbing
  - `checks.nix` pre-commit-hooks for this repository
  - `colmena.nix` Setup for distributed deployment using colmena (actually defines all NixOS hosts)
  - `dev-shell.nix` Environment setup for `nix develop` for using this flake
  - `extra-builtins.nix` Extra builtins via nix-plugins to support transparent repository-wide secrets
  - `generate-installer.nix` Helper functions to generate a iso image for any host for simple deployment from scratch. The iso will contain an executable `install-system` that will do a full install including partitioning.
  - `generate-node.nix` Helper function that outputs everything that is necessary to define a new node in a predictable format. Used to define colmena nodes and microvms.
  - `lib.nix` Commonly used functionality or helpers that weren't available in the standard library
  - `rage-decrypt-and-cache.sh` Auxiliary script for repository-wide secrets that decrypts a file and caches the output in /tmp

## How-To

#### Add new machine

... incomplete.

- add <name> to `hosts` in `flake.nix`
- create hosts/<name>
- fill net.nix
- fill fs.nix (you need to know the device by-id paths in advance for formatting to work!)
- run generate-secrets

#### Initial deploy

A. Fresh pre-made installer ISO

- Create a iso disk image for the system with `nix build --print-out-paths --no-link .#installer-image-<host>`
- dd the resulting image to a stick and boot from it on the target
- (Optional) ssh into the target (keys are already set up)

B. Reusing any nixos-live iso

- Boot from live-iso and setup ssh access by writing your key to `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`
- Copy installer package with `nix copy --to <target> .#installer-package-<host>`

Afterwards:

- Run `install-system` and reboot
- Retrieve the new host identity by using `ssh-keyscan <host/ip> | grep -o 'ed25519.*' > host/<host>/secrets/host.pub`
- (If the host has microvms, also retrieve their identities!)
- Rekey the secrets for the new identity `nix run .#rekey`
- Deploy again remotely via colmena

#### Remote encrypted unlock

If a host uses encrypted root together with the `common/initrd-ssh.nix` module,
it can be unlocked remotely by connecting via ssh on port 4 and executing `systemd-tty-ask-password-agent`.

#### Show QR for external wireguard client

nix run show-wireguard-qr
then select the host in the fzf menu

#### New secret

...

## Stuff

- Secrets can be created/edited by running `nix run .#edit-secret some/secret.age`
- Secrets can be rekeyed by running `nix run .#rekey` (you will also be prompted to do so in an error message if neccessary)

To be able to decrypt the repository-wide secrets transparently on a host that
is _not_ managed by this config, you will need to <sub>(be me and)</sub> run
all commands using these extra parameters, or permanently add the following the system's `nix.conf`:

1. Get nix-plugins: `NIX_PLUGINS=$(nix build --print-out-paths --no-link nixpkgs#nix-plugins)`
2. Run all commands with `--option plugin-files "$NIX_PLUGINS"/lib/nix/plugins --option extra-builtins-file ./nix/extra-builtins.nix`
   or permantently

  ```ini
  plugin-files = <copy path from $NIX_PLUGINS>/lib/nix/plugins
  extra-builtins-file = /path/to/nix-config/nix/extra-builtins.nix
  ```

## Misc

Generate self-signed cert, e.g. for kanidm internal communication to proxy:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -days 3650 -nodes \
  -keyout selfcert.key -out selfcert.crt -subj \
  "/CN=example.com" -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:example.com,DNS:sub1.example.com,DNS:sub2.example.com,IP:10.0.0.1"
```
